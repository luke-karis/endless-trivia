# Endless Trivia

Welcome to my trivia website!

Currently you can access this the website by going https://luke-karis.github.io/endless-trivia/ but I plan to buy a domain name soon.

# Gameplay Instructions

The goal of the game is to answer as many 20 questions before running out of lives

Every question can be answered by typing in a guess in the intput box. Try your best to spell the answer correctly but the code does check the distance between your guess and the real answer so you will probably be fine if you slightly missspell your guess.

multiple choice: you have a limited number of times you can generate multiple choices for a question so use them wisely!

lives: everytime you get a question wrong you will lose a life, if you run out of lives you lose.

difficulty: the game should get more diffifuclt over time
